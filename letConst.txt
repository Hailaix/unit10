1. The main differences between let and var are that let opperates in a stricter scope than var being tied specifically to the block it is contained within, a variable declared with let cannot be redeclared, and they are not hoisted.
2. Variables declared with const, similarly to let, are also scoped at the block level, cannot be redeclared and are not hoisted. Additionally const variables cannot be reassigned.
3. Unlike let variables, const variables cannot be reassigned after declaration.
4. Hoisting causes variables to act as though they are declared at the beginning of their scope, regardless of when they are actually declared.
